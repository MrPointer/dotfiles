# Global Rules

## General Guidelines

- Do only what you've been asked for. If you think more could be done, consult before doing it.
- Ask for clarification if the request is ambiguous.

## Coding Guidelines

- NEVER write example code unless expressly asked.
- Do not leave meta-comments about the edit session in code.
- Always assume the current file state is correct - never revert based on cached/stale versions.
- Clean up any temporary files, scripts, or helpers created during the task.

## Session Summaries

- Summarize work at the end of edit sessions.
- Keep summaries concise with bullet points.
- Highlight key changes and important information.
- Use a few emojis sparingly to make summaries more engaging (don't overdo it).
