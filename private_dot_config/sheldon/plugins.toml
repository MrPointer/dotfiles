# Optimized Sheldon Configuration for Fast Startup
# =================================================
# This configuration prioritizes shell responsiveness by:
# - Loading only essential plugins immediately
# - Deferring non-critical plugins for background loading
# - Using efficient defer templates

shell = "zsh"

[plugins]

# =============================================================================
# CRITICAL PLUGINS (Load Immediately)
# =============================================================================
# These plugins are essential for core shell functionality and must load first

[plugins.zsh-defer]
github = "romkatv/zsh-defer"
# MUST be first - provides defer functionality for other plugins

[plugins.powerlevel10k]
github = "romkatv/powerlevel10k"
# MUST load early for instant prompt to work

[plugins.zsh-completions]
github = "zsh-users/zsh-completions"
# Load immediately - provides essential completions

[plugins.fzf-tab]
github = "Aloxaf/fzf-tab"
# Load immediately - critical for interactive tab completion

# =============================================================================
# DEFERRED PLUGINS (Background Loading)
# =============================================================================
# These plugins enhance the experience but don't need to block startup

[plugins.zsh-syntax-highlighting]
github = "zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting"
apply = ["defer"]
# Visual enhancement - can load in background

[plugins.zsh-autosuggestions]
github = "zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions"
apply = ["defer"]
# Convenience feature - can load in background

[plugins.git-clean-branch]
github = "gobriansteele/git-clean-branch"
apply = ["defer"]
# Utility command - not needed immediately

[plugins.zsh-diff-so-fancy]
github = "so-fancy/diff-so-fancy"
apply = ["defer"]
# Visual enhancement - can wait

[plugins.zsh-sudo]
github = "none9632/zsh-sudo"
apply = ["defer"]
# Convenience feature - can load later

[plugins.zsh-eza-ls]
github = "birdhackor/zsh-eza-ls-plugin"
apply = ["defer"]
# Visual enhancement - not critical for startup

# =============================================================================
# TEMPLATES
# =============================================================================

[templates]
# Optimized defer template using zsh-defer -c for cleaner execution
defer = """{{ hooks?.pre | nl }}{% for file in files %}zsh-defer -c 'source "{{ file }}"'
{% endfor %}{{ hooks?.post | nl }}"""

# Alternative defer template with timing (uncomment for debugging)
# defer-timed = """{{ hooks?.pre | nl }}{% for file in files %}zsh-defer -t 0.1 source "{{ file }}"
# {% endfor %}{{ hooks?.post | nl }}"""
