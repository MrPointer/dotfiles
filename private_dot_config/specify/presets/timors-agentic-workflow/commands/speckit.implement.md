## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Mandatory Preset Preflight

This is the first operational action of the command. Before reading or invoking extension hooks, running `{SCRIPT}`, creating or updating progress, mutating a workspace or project file, creating/switching a branch or worktree, or dispatching a worker:

1. Read `.specify/presets/timors-agentic-workflow/references/execution-lifecycle.md` and complete its entire Command-Wide Preflight in order, beginning with the compatibility gate in `protocol-compatibility.md`.
2. For its structural validation step, consume the unchanged installed `.specify/presets/timors-agentic-workflow/references/artifact-validation.md` as the shared deterministic validator used by analyze. Do not reproduce its invariants in this command.

Fail closed before hooks, scripts, writes, workspace operations, or dispatch. The analysis/report/approval checks establish structural consumption safety; do not perform a new semantic review or revoke an authorized result.

## Pre-Execution Checks

**Check for extension hooks (before implementation)**:
- Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.before_implement` key
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue normally
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Pre-Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}

    Wait for the result of the hook command before proceeding to the Outline.
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
- If no hooks are registered or `.specify/extensions.yml` does not exist, skip silently

## Outline

1. Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot"). Confirm the returned feature directory is the exact directory validated by the Mandatory Preset Preflight. If it differs, stop and rerun the complete preflight against the returned directory before any further mutation.

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:

     ```text
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     ```

   - Calculate overall status:
     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items

   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     - Display the table with incomplete item counts
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **REQUIRED**: Read execution-plan.md for validated groups, dependencies, ownership, models, skills, capabilities, contracts, tests, acceptance criteria, and verification
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read /memory/constitution.md for governance constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:

   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```

   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore
   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exists → create/verify .terraformignore
   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore

   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology
   **Progress ignore seam**: Before creating progress, ensure `specs/<feature>/progress.md` is ignored by an appropriate project ignore mechanism. Never add progress to a checkpoint.

   **Common Patterns by Technology** (from plan.md tech stack):
   - **Node.js/JavaScript/TypeScript**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Python**: `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `.venv/`, `venv/`, `dist/`, `*.egg-info/`
   - **Java**: `target/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `.gradle/`, `build/`
   - **C#/.NET**: `bin/`, `obj/`, `*.user`, `*.suo`, `packages/`
   - **Go**: `*.exe`, `*.test`, `vendor/`, `*.out`
   - **Ruby**: `.bundle/`, `log/`, `tmp/`, `*.gem`, `vendor/bundle/`
   - **PHP**: `vendor/`, `*.log`, `*.cache`, `*.env`
   - **Rust**: `target/`, `debug/`, `release/`, `*.rs.bk`, `*.rlib`, `*.prof*`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Kotlin**: `build/`, `out/`, `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, `*.class`, `*.jar`, `*.iml`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **C++**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.so`, `*.a`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **C**: `build/`, `bin/`, `obj/`, `out/`, `*.o`, `*.a`, `*.so`, `*.exe`, `*.dll`, `autom4te.cache/`, `config.status`, `config.log`, `.idea/`, `*.log`, `.env*`
   - **Swift**: `.build/`, `DerivedData/`, `*.swiftpm/`, `Packages/`
   - **R**: `.Rproj.user/`, `.Rhistory`, `.RData`, `.Ruserdata`, `*.Rproj`, `packrat/`, `renv/`
   - **Universal**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.tmp`, `*.swp`, `.vscode/`, `.idea/`

   **Tool-Specific Patterns**:
   - **Docker**: `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `Dockerfile*`, `.dockerignore`, `*.log*`, `.env*`, `coverage/`
   - **ESLint**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `*.min.js`
   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`
   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`

5. Initialize or resume ignored `FEATURE_DIR/progress.md` from `.specify/presets/timors-agentic-workflow/templates/progress-template.md`. Apply the exact resume matrix in `execution-lifecycle.md` before dispatch. Missing local state never causes automatic redispatch.

6. Parse tasks.md and the validated execution plan without changing either:
   - Preserve the canonical task IDs, current checkbox lines, task phases (Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish), and TDD ordering.
   - Use only canonical execution groups, explicit dependencies, Execution Order, Concurrency Policy, File Ownership, model tier, exact skills, exact capabilities, contracts, Test Expectation, acceptance criteria, and verification.
   - Construct each packet only by the canonical join defined in `execution-lifecycle.md`, including prerequisite outputs through `DFNN` and `CTNN`.
   - Never invent, remove, regroup, or revise planned execution data.

7. Execute implementation by applying, in order:
   - `.specify/presets/timors-agentic-workflow/references/execution-lifecycle.md`
   - `.specify/presets/timors-agentic-workflow/references/workspace-isolation.md`
   - `.specify/presets/timors-agentic-workflow/references/checkpoint-integration.md`

   Run the ready-group gate immediately before each group mutates a workspace, edits, or dispatches. A parallel set starts only after every member passes. Keep tests with the same bound implementation worker. Do not invoke `executing-plans`, provision runtime workers through this preset, or permit child-agent dispatch.

8. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each attributable transition and preserve the exact template sections, tables, columns, and states.
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails.
   - For policy-permitted parallel groups, continue with successful independent groups only as allowed by the validated dependencies and report failed groups.
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging.
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed.
   - **IMPORTANT** Mark covered tasks `[X]` only in the completion order defined by `execution-lifecycle.md`, after integration, verification, signed checkpoint creation, and persisted evidence.

9. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed and all execution groups are `done`.
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification without changing acceptance criteria.
   - Validate that tests pass and planned coverage/evidence requirements are met.
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan and validated execution plan.
   - Run final verification, retain the signed tip at `refs/agent-checkpoints/<feature>`, record the checkpoint range, and prepare the aggregate dirty diff exactly as required by `checkpoint-integration.md`.

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown and protocol-valid execution plan exist. If tasks are incomplete or artifacts fail deterministic validation, suggest running `__SPECKIT_COMMAND_TASKS__` to regenerate the task list and execution artifacts.

## Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks

**You MUST complete this section before reporting completion to the user.**

Check if `.specify/extensions.yml` exists in the project root.
- If it does not exist, or no hooks are registered under `hooks.after_implement`, skip to the Completion Report.
- If it exists, read it and look for entries under the `hooks.after_implement` key.
- If the YAML cannot be parsed or is invalid, skip hook checking silently and continue to the Completion Report.
- Filter out hooks where `enabled` is explicitly `false`. Treat hooks without an `enabled` field as enabled by default.
- For each remaining hook, do **not** attempt to interpret or evaluate hook `condition` expressions:
  - If the hook has no `condition` field, or it is null/empty, treat the hook as executable
  - If the hook defines a non-empty `condition`, skip the hook and leave condition evaluation to the HookExecutor implementation
- For each executable hook, output the following based on its `optional` flag:
  - **Mandatory hook** (`optional: false`) — **You MUST emit `EXECUTE_COMMAND:` for each mandatory hook**:
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Automatic Hook**: {extension}
    Executing: `/{command}`
    EXECUTE_COMMAND: {command}
    ```
    After emitting the block above you MUST actually invoke the hook and wait for it to finish before continuing. Run it the same way you would run the command yourself in this agent/session (the invocation may differ from the literal `{command}` id shown above, e.g. a skills-mode agent runs it as `/skill:speckit-...` or `$speckit-...`). Emitting the block alone does not run the hook.
  - **Optional hook** (`optional: true`):
    ```
    ## Extension Hooks

    **Optional Hook**: {extension}
    Command: `/{command}`
    Description: {description}

    Prompt: {prompt}
    To execute: `/{command}`
    ```

## Completion Report

Report final status with summary of completed work, retained checkpoint ref/range, aggregate dirty-diff location, verification, blocked or recovery-required state, and any retained workspaces.

## Done When

- [ ] The compatibility, shared artifact-validation, report-consistency, and authorizing Approval Record gates passed before hooks, scripts, mutations, or dispatch
- [ ] All tasks in tasks.md completed and marked `[X]` only after their groups' signed checkpoints and evidence
- [ ] Implementation validated against specification, plan, execution plan, and planned test coverage
- [ ] Final verification passed and the retained checkpoint ref/range plus aggregate dirty diff are recorded
- [ ] Extension hooks dispatched or skipped according to the rules in Mandatory Post-Execution Hooks above
- [ ] Completion reported to user with summary of completed work
